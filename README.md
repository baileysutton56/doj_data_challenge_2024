# Measuring Community Impacts of the Opioid Epidemic
Over the last decade, the opioid epidemic has ravaged communities across the United States, leading to significant public safety and public health concerns. Despite the widespread devastation of this epidemic, models seeking to measure its causes and effects have primarily been limited to individual-level metrics, like usage and death rates. Our project identifies an alternate measure, the NFLIS-Drug state labs positive reports for opioids, to better assess the impact at the community-level. We use variables from FQHCs to model the impacts on communities rather than individuals. Our models find that the total reports positive for opioids measure may be more effective than death rate at evaluating the impact of the opioid epidemic, and that FQHCs play a vital role at minimizing the negative consequences of opioid addiction.
