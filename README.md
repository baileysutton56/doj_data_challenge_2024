# Measuring Community Impacts of the Opioid Epidemic
This project was completed as part of the [Department of Justice's 2024 Data Challenge](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=doj-data-challenge-2024&tab=overview) and received first prize.

Over the last decade, the opioid epidemic has ravaged communities across the United States, leading to significant public safety and public health concerns. Despite the widespread devastation of this epidemic, models seeking to measure its causes and effects have primarily been limited to individual-level metrics, like usage and death rates. Our project identifies an alternate measure, the NFLIS-Drug state labs positive reports for opioids, to better assess the impact at the community-level. We use variables from Federall-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) to model the impacts on communities rather than individuals. We find that the total positive reports for opioids measure may be more effective than death rate at evaluating the impact of the opioid epidemic, and that FQHCs play a vital role at minimizing the negative consequences of opioid addiction.

- **ðŸ’¾ data-cleaning:** .R and .Rmd files used to clean data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and Census Bureau 
- **ðŸ“š documentation:** Documentation of variables included from Census Bureau and DOJ datasets
- **ðŸ“ˆ final-materials:** Final report and presentations
- **ðŸ’» final-models:** .Rmd files used to create models and graphics

## Data
We used four primary datasets for analysis:

- [National Forensic Information Laboratory Information Systems (NFLIS) Public Drug Data](https://www.nflis.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/) from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA)
- [Underlying Cause of Dealth](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html) from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
- [Uniform Data System](https://www.hrsa.gov/foia/electronic-reading) from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)
- [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://data.census.gov/) from the Census Bureau
